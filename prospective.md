## Prospective Students

I am always interested in connecting with motivated students interested in applying their skills to atmospheric chemistry modelling. Previous experience with computer programming is useful but not necessary, and I am open to enquiries from students with a background in chemistry, earth science, environmental science, math, physics, computer science (and possibly others!). Women and non-binary folx and members of other underrepresented and marginalised groups are strongly encouraged to apply.
***Please note that in my current position I have limited capacity to supervise students.***

**PhD/Masters**. I am able to accept at most 1 new PhD student each year (as primary supervisor). **At present, I am not expecting to take on any new students in the near future.** Prospective students should contact me before applying for admission and funding via the JCU Graduate Research School (due in August). If you are interested in applying, please email me with subject “Prospective PhD Application” and include (1) a cover letter; (2) a short statement of research interests and any prior research experience, including contributions to any presentations or publications; (3) transcripts from undergraduate and (if relevant masters) degrees; (4) contact information for two academic references. For reasons of equity, all applications received by 15 June will be reviewed at the same time (for autumn session start). For mid-year start, please contact me directly to discuss options. International students: please note that the academic year in Australia starts in February, and that international PhD scholarships are highly competitive (typically requiring you to already have your own publication(s)).

**Honours**. I can supervise up to 1 Honours student per year. My research is most closely aligned with students studying chemistry, data science or environmental science, but I am open to enquiries from other disciplines. If you are a JCU student interested in an honours project in atmospheric chemistry, please email me to arrange a meeting. If you are a non-JCU student interested in pursuing Honours at JCU, contact me as early as possible so that we can discuss possibilities.

**Undergraduate Research**. I am always open to enquiries from undergraduates interested in research, either as an internship subject or over a session breaks. Please email me to discuss possible opportunities. I can typically come up with projects to suit students with different backgrounds and levels of experience. Depending on individual circumstances, students may be able to receive subject credit or wages for participating in research.
