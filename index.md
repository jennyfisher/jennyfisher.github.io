### Research Overview
My research centres on investigating the sources, chemical evolution, and transport pathways of atmospheric pollution. I use a global chemical transport model combined with observational data sets (ground-based, aircraft, and satellite) to increase our fundamental understanding of the impacts of human activity and natural processes on atmospheric composition in diverse environments.

### Teaching Overview
I teach earth systems science and introductory programming to undergraduate students. For more details, including my teaching philosophy, please see my [teaching portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/jfisher-teaching-portfolio/home).

### News
- From January to June 2024, I am spending my sabbatical as an Australian Science Policy Fellow, hosted by the Australian Government Department of Industry, Science and Resources.
- We're excited to welcome Beth Killen to the group! Beth is a new PhD student at UNSW who will help us continue to build bridges between laboratory experiments in the Kable group at UNSW and global atmospheric modelling in the UOW Centre for Atmospheric Chemistry.
- After 3.5 years as Associate Dean (Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) in SMAH, my term officially came to an end in December 2023. I feel so privileged to have been in the position, learned so much, and worked with so many incredible people. I'm proud of what we accomplished, and know there is much still to do.
- Two graduations! Jhonathan Ramirez Gamboa and Maria Paula Pérez Peña both officially graduated in 2023. After years of COVID hiatus, it was such a joy to be part of their graduation ceremonies.
- Two new papers published! As part of the global mercury synthesis effort published in *Ambio*, we wrote two papers synthesising Mercury in the Southern Hemisphere, one on natural processes ([Schneider et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-023-01832-5)) and one on anthropogenic processes ([Fisher et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-023-01840-5)). We explore how the southern hemisphere and tropics are different from the northern hemisphere in ways that impact mercury cycling, science, and ultimately policy.
