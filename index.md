### Research Overview
My research centres on investigating the sources, chemical evolution, and transport pathways of atmospheric pollution. I use a global chemical transport model combined with observational data sets (ground-based, aircraft, and satellite) to increase our fundamental understanding of the impacts of human activity and natural processes on atmospheric composition in diverse environments.

### Teaching Overview
I teach earth systems science and introductory programming to undergraduate students. For more details, including my teaching philosophy, please see my [teaching portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/jfisher-teaching-portfolio/home). To access the Jupyter notebooks I use for teaching Python, please see my [teaching Github page](https://jennyfisher.github.io/computing-modelling-earthsci/).

### News
- As of January 2025, I have started a new position as Associate Dean Learning and Teaching in the College of Science and Engineering at James Cook University (JCU).
- New paper published, led by former Master's student Neil Page. The paper delves into the environmental drivers of bromine monoxide and mercury variability in coastal East Antarctica. Read at [*Atmospheric Environment*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120918).
- From January to December 2024, I spent my sabbatical as an Australian Science Policy Fellow, hosted by the Australian Government Department of Industry, Science and Resources.
